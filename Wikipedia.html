<p>From Wikipedia,the free encyclopedia</p>
<p>St.Michael is a city in eastern Wright County, northwest of the Minneapolis-St Paul "Twin Cities" Metoplitan Area. The population was 16,399 at the 2010 census.</p>
	<h2 id="geo">Geography [Edit]</h2>

	<h2 id="histor">History [Edit]</h2>
	<p>A post office called St. Michael has been in operation since 1858. The city took its name from St. Michael Roman Catholic Church. St. Michael was incorporated in 1890. The Corner Bar, a restaurant in service since 1897, was on 10 Main Street South downtown which shut down January 9, 2020 and was razed on Friday, August 14, 2020. Generational patrons drove by and many stopped to collect a brick or two to commemorate the end of this era. Oddly enough the founding father of Ditto's Bar, down the street from the Corner Bar, also left this earth days later while the name and establishment still live on in Main Street. A complete history of the city, ‘’Faith, Family and Farming’’, was written by Bob Zahler. The history is also tracked by the St. Michael Historical Society, whose mission is "to collect, preserve and share the history of the City of St. Michael."</p>
